Some instructions for the class final project.

# Data cleaning / processing

When cleaning the data, you will need to translate from messy data to meaningful featuers. You will consult with a medical expert to help decide which variables to use + how to process them.
Come prepared to this meeting with a list of variables and questions about them. Examples:
- are these variables available at the time when the clinical decision rule is used?
- is this variable always available?
- what does it mean for these variables to be "missing" - can they be imputed using other information?
- should this variable be discretized / binarized?

Eventually, the final variables you use should be written into the file `data_dictionary.md`.

# Writeup

Do write comments in the code - we will be checking these!

Guidance for doing data-science in this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TwriYzT24IXRL-81XbNEKqbseOopQvr80j6VWM4w2nE/edit).

The lab writeup should be inside the project folder (e.g. `rulevetting/projects/iai_pecarn/writeup.pdf`) and answer these questions in a file named `writeup.pdf`. The accomanying source file `writeup.Rmd` (or `writeup.md`) should also be inside the project folder. Figures should all be in a subdirectory named `figs`.
