> **Abstract**
> 
> Study objective: The overall objective of this study is to develop a clinical decision rule for appropriate neuroimaging of children after minor-to-moderate head trauma. The goal of the study is to create a decision rule which identifies those children in need of emergent imaging (i.e. CT scan) and treatment, while reducing the use of head CT scans in those children with minimal risk of traumatic brain injuries.
