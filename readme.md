This is a *collaborative* repository intended to validate and derive clinical-decision rules.
We hope to use a unified modeling pipeline across a variety of contributed datasets to standardize and improve previous modeling practices for clinical decision rules.
Additionally, we hope to externally validate the rules under study here with data from UCSF.

Datasets must be tabular (or at least have interpretable input features), be reasonably large (e.g. have at least 100 positive and negative cases), and have a binary outcome. If this goes well, might also expand to other high-stakes datasets (e.g. COMPAS, loan risk).

To use PECARN datasets, please read an agree to the research data use agreement on the [PECARN website](https://pecarn.org/datasets/).

# How do I contribute?

To contribute a new project (e.g. a new dataset + modeling), create a pull request following the steps belwo.
The easiest way to do this is to copy-paste an existing project (e.g. [iai_pecarn](mrules/projects/iai_pecarn)) into a new folder and then edit that one.

- [ ] Repo set up
  - [ ] Create a fork of this repo
  - [ ] Install the repo as shown above
  - [ ] Select a dataset - once you've selected, open an issue in this repo with the name of the dataset + a brief description so others don't work on the same dataset 	
  - [ ] Come up with a `project_name` for the new project (e.g. iai_pecarn) 	
- [ ] Data preprocessing
  - [ ] Download the raw data into `data/{project_name}/raw`
  - [ ] Copy over the template files from `mrules/projects/iai_pecarn` to a new folder `mrules/projects/{project_name}`
  - [ ] Rewrite the functions in `mrules/projects/{project_name}/dataset.py` for processing the new dataset (e.g. see the dataset for [iai_pecarn](mrules/projects/iai_pecarn/dataset.py))
	- Note: Notebooks / helper functions are optional
    - See [the template file](mrules/templates/dataset.py) for documentation of each function
- [ ] Data description
  - [ ] Add a `mrules/projects/{project_name}/data_dictionary.md` file that describes each feature in the processed data
  - [ ] Add a `mrules/projects/{project_name}/readme.md` file that describes the data and the prediction task. This should include basic details of data collection (who, how, when, where) and why it is important, and how a clinical decision rule may be used in this context. Should also include your names/affiliations.
- [ ] Modeling
  - [ ] Implement the functions in `mrules/projects/{project_name}/baseline.py` for predicting given a baseline rule (if there is no existing rule for this project, then have each method simply return None)
    - See [the template file](mrules/templates/baseline.py) for documentation of each function
- [ ] Merging
  - [ ] Ensure that all tests pass by running `pytest` from the repo directory
  - [ ] Open a pull request and it will be reviewed / merged	


**What is included in each step.**

- modeling
	- build and test the original model
	- run many models from imodels
	- extract out stable rules: screen for high predictive acc, look at what is kept
	- build stable rules model (e.g. using RuleFit or Corels)
- validation
	- predictive accuracy
	- number of rules
	- overlap with original rules?
- test
	- run on UCSF held-out data?
- documentation is available in the [API](yu-group.github.io/medical-rules/)


# Installation

Note: requires python 3.7 and pytest (for running the automated tests). 
It is best practice to create a virtualenv or pipenv for this project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yu-Group/medical-rules
cd medical-rules
python setup.py sdist
pip install -e .
```

Now run the automatic tests to ensure everything works.

```
pytest
```
